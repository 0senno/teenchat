**WARN > MUTE > KICK** is the mod protocol for almost everything you should do, unless otherwise specified and for the same offense

**WARN**: Just as it says, warn the user to stop doing what he / she is doing, you should ping/pm the user, a general warning such as “Keep it clean” should also be given before you take action

**MUTE**: A mute is only 5m / 10m / 15m, a mute should be given after a warning has been given and if they have continued their offense.

**KICK**: Basically is a temporary ban, this should be taken out after a mute has been given, this should start at 5 mins and carry on from there, kicks are 5m / 10m / 15m / 30m and 1 or 2 hours. This should start at 5 mins after a mute and proceed to increase the kick each time. There is no reason to start at 1 or 2 hour kicks for anything but max kick offenses.
